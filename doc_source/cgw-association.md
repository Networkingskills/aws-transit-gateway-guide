# Customer gateway associations<a name="cgw-association"></a>

To add your on\-premises network to your global network, you associate a customer gateway with your device, and optionally, a link\. The customer gateway must already be in your global network as part of a VPN attachment in your transit gateway\. If you specify a link, it must already be associated with the specified device\.

For more information about creating a customer gateway, see [Create a Customer Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/SetUpVPNConnections.html#vpn-create-cgw) in the *AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN User Guide*\. For more information about creating a VPN attachment to a transit gateway, see [Transit Gateway VPN Attachments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-vpn-attachments.html) in *Amazon VPC Transit Gateways*\.

For more information about viewing the topology of your on\-premises network in Network Manager, see [Topology](network-manager-monitor-console.md#network-manager-topology)\.
